🧠 GPT from Scratch — Character-Level Language Model in PyTorch
This project demonstrates how to build and train a simplified version of a GPT-style transformer model entirely from scratch using PyTorch. The model is trained on character-level data and learns to generate text one character at a time.

🚀 Features
✅ Byte-level tokenization with a character vocabulary

✅ Bigram baseline model

✅ Transformer architecture with:

Multi-head self-attention

Positional encoding

Layer normalization and residual connections

✅ Training loop with cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer

✅ Text generation using greedy decoding

✅ Modular and easy-to-understand code structure

🧪 How It Works
The model is trained to predict the next character given a sequence of previous characters.

It learns character dependencies using self-attention, allowing it to understand context and patterns in the data.

The generate() method can be used to produce novel text after training.

📦 Setup
1. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install torch
(Optional if using Colab: switch runtime to GPU under Runtime → Change runtime type.)

2. Prepare Dataset
Replace data.txt with any plain-text corpus of your choice.

3. Train the Model
bash
Copy code
python train.py
This will train the model and save the weights to model_weights.pth.

4. Generate Text
bash
Copy code
python generate.py
You can adjust generation parameters such as context size or number of tokens.

📌 Notes
This is a minimal implementation intended for educational and experimental purposes.

Ideal for learning how transformer models work under the hood.

Can be extended to use word-level tokenization, deeper models, temperature sampling, and more.
